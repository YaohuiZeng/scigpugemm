Installation Instructions
-------------------------

At some point, a 'configure' script may appear, for now things are quite basic.


Compiling the Library
---------------------

To compile the library, do
cd src/
make
Before this, you will need to set up your environment variables, specifically CPATH:
export CPATH="/path/to/cuda/toolkit/include/"


Compiling the Examples
----------------------

To compile the examples, do
cd <example>
make
In addition to CPATH, you will need to ensure that LIBRARY_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH enable the compiler to find CBLAS/ATLAS and CUDA. Something akin to
export CPATH="/path/to/cuda/toolkit/include/:/usr/include/atlas"
export LIBRARY_PATH="/path/to/cuda/toolkit/lib:/usr/lib64/atlas"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/path/to/cuda/toolkit/lib:/usr/lib64/atlas"


Full Build
----------

From the base directory (the one containing this file) simply enter
make
once all the environment variables have been set up
