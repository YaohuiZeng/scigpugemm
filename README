SciGPU-GEMM Library
===================


SciGPU-GEMM is a library of wrapper functions to help use the GEMM routines from CUBLAS on GPUs with
a) Limited memory
b) No double precision hardware

The GEMMcleaver class enables DGEMM and SGEMM calls to run on limited memory GPUs, by performing a series of multiplications between sub-matrices.

The MGEMM class circumvents a lack of double precision GPU hardware by performing most of the multiplication on the GPU in single precision, and handling the remainder in double precision on the CPU.


Documentation
-------------

The code is documented with doxygen.
cd docs/
make docs
will build the HTML and LaTeX manuals. If only documentation on the public portion of the code is required, use
make docs-public
instead.

Building
--------

To build the library
cd src/
make
The library is placed in the lib/ directory. The Makefile assumes that $CPATH includes the path to the CUDA header files


Examples
--------

Several examples are provided in the examples/ directory. These can be used to test the library, as well as generate some performance statistics. To build an example, run
make
in the appropriate directory. The binaries are placed in the bin/ directory (which will be created if necessary). Before building the examples, make sure that your $CPATH, $LIBRARY_PATH and $LD_LIBRARY_PATH will all enable the compiler and linker to find CBLAS/ATLAS and CUDA


Full Build
----------

In the current directory, enter
make
to build the entire package. This runs each of the make commands described above.
